# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

The project aims to develop an inventory management system for the research laboratories at Sapienza University of Rome. This system is designed to improve the management and control of resources used in research projects, ensuring greater operational efficiency, reducing waste, and providing continuous support to scientific activities. The primary objective is to create an intuitive and functional tool that allows real-time stock monitoring and simplifies communication among laboratory members.\
The platform will be managed by two types of users: the lab manager, who will act as the administrator, and the researchers, who will use the system for operational tasks. The lab manager will be responsible for configuring the system by setting material categories, adding new items, and defining reorder thresholds for each resource. Additionally, they will assign materials to researchers and monitor resource usage through periodic reports. These reports will provide a clear and detailed overview of material consumption, helping to plan procurement and manage budgets more efficiently.\
Researchers will use the system to access information about the materials available to them, update stock levels after usage, and report specific needs. For example, if a researcher notices that a material is running low, they can submit a request through the system, which will notify the lab manager. This collaborative approach will enable transparent and effective management, reducing the risk of interruptions due to insufficient stock.\
Among the system's primary use cases, the lab manager can configure the platform to meet the laboratory's specific needs by creating material categories and setting stock management rules. Researchers will update the system to reflect material usage during their daily activities, ensuring accurate monitoring. Another significant use case involves researchers submitting requests for unavailable materials or reporting damaged equipment, allowing the lab manager to address the issue promptly.\
This system will be a fundamental tool for improving resource management in research laboratories, making operations more organized and ensuring that every laboratory member has access to the information needed to carry out their work efficiently. The platform will also be flexible and adaptable to other contexts or departments in the future, meeting the dynamic needs of scientific\'a0research.\

# USER STORIES:

1. As a lab manager, I want to create and edit material categories so that I can organize inventory items logically and make them easier to manage.

2. As a lab manager, I want to add new materials (with details such as name, category, and stock level) so that all resources used in the lab are tracked in the system.

3. As a lab manager, I want to set reorder thresholds for each material so that I receive alerts when stock levels fall below the defined minimum.

4. As a lab manager, I want to assign specific materials to individual researchers or research groups so that responsibilities and access rights are clearly defined.

5. As a lab manager, I want to view and download periodic reports of material usage so that I can plan procurement and manage the laboratory budget more efficiently.

6. As a lab manager, I want to receive notifications about material requests or reported damaged equipment so that I can take prompt action and avoid disruptions to research activities.

7. As a researcher, I want to view a real-time list of available materials assigned to my department so that I know exactly what resources I can use for my projects.

8. As a researcher, I want to update stock levels after I use materials so that the inventory remains accurate for all laboratory members.

9. As a researcher, I want to submit requests for materials that are low or unavailable so that the lab manager can reorder them in time.

10. As a researcher, I want to report damaged or malfunctioning equipment through the system so that the issue is documented and addressed promptly.

11. As a researcher, I want to track the status of my material requests so that I know when new supplies or replacements will arrive.

12. As a laboratory member, I want the system to provide real-time stock updates so that everyone can make decisions based on accurate, up-to-date information.

13. As a laboratory member, I want the system interface to be intuitive and easy to use so that I can manage my tasks without requiring extensive training.

14. As an administrator, I want the system to be configurable and adaptable to other contexts or departments so that it can be scaled or reused  across the university.
